# Cab Fare Prediction

This project predicts taxi fare amounts using various regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.  
It includes extensive data cleaning, feature engineering (like datetime extraction and haversine distance), visualization, and hyperparameter tuning.

# Tech Used
- Python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn, RandomForestRegressor, GridSearchCV

# How to Run
1. Place `Train.csv` and `Test.csv` in the working directory.
2. Run: `python cab_fare_prediction.py`
